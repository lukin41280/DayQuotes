A quick weekend Rails web app I made to practice with APIs and JavaScript.  The app generates a daily quote to present during our morning stand-ups at Dev Bootcamp

Deployed to Heroku:
* http://day-quotes1.herokuapp.com/

The app uses the They Said So api to retrieve a daily quote.  Animation is done with textillate.js which depends on animate.css and letters.js

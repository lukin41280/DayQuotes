A quick Rails web app I made to practice with APIs and JavaScript will attending [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/locations/austin/).  The app generates a daily quote to present to everyone during our morning stand-ups.

The app uses the They Said So api to retrieve a daily quote.  Animation is done using textillate.js, animate.css, and letters.js.
